    <p>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but he's a <i>little</i> 
    disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.<br><br>

    Jack would really like...

   <div style="text-align">
    <ul>
        <li>Roller blades</li>
        <li>Magic tricks</li>
        <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
        <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
    </ul>
   </div>

    You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are <a href="www.toysrus.com">toyrus.com</a> 
    and <a href="www.etoys.com">eToys</a>
