<h2>Fantastic Frenchies</h2>
    <align-left><p>The feisty French Bulldog can be a wonderful canine companion. The French Bulldog descended from the English Bulldog in the 1800â€™s when it was translocated to France.
 The breed has flourished as an adored companion ever since. The Frenchie is known for its bat-like ears and short, wrinkled nose. They tend to have a curious and 
 gentle nature and is notorious for being the class clown. They will often have sporadic bouts of energy followed by prolonged periods of resting. They are loyal and 
 loving and prefers to not be left alone at home. The French Bulldog is a generally healthy breed with an average lifespan of 11-12 years.</p> <br>
