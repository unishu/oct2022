<h2 style="font-style: oblique"> Bulldog; Frenchie</h2>
<p>With their short snouts, wrinkled faces, and 'bat ears,' these mini-clowns evoke smiles wherever they go. French Bulldogs—or Frenchies—are smart, sweet-natured 
    dogs who have plenty of energy for brisk walks as long as they are followed by ample lap time at home. Though usually very quiet, they are attentive watchdogs who 
    will bark with gusto when someone's at the door. They have a stubborn streak but are also eager to please, which makes them utterly charming companions when given 
    lots of patient training and love. <br>
